## dart2native

Use the dart2native command to AOT (ahead-of-time) compile a Dart program to native x64 machine code. The dart2native command is supported on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

The default output of dart2native is a standalone executable. A standalone executable is native machine code thatâ€™s compiled from the specified Dart file and its dependencies, plus a small Dart runtime that handles type checking and garbage collection.

- run `dart2native hello.dart` or `dart2native hello.dart -o hello.exe`
